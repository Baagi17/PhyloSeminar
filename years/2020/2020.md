* Grad Seminar 460
* Class Number 67082
* Time: Mondays at noon
* Class website: [https://mikeryanmay.github.io/IB290/years/2020/2020](https://mikeryanmay.github.io/years/IB290/2020/2020)


## Instructors

* Carl Rothfels -- crothfels@berkeley.edu
* John Huelsenbeck -- johnh@berkeley.edu
* Mike May -- mrmay@berkeley.edu


## Format

We haven't fully settled on the format yet, but the core of the seminar will be paper-based discussions (i.e., discussions of phylogenetics papers). We can also have a series of introductory lectures, as desired.


## Course Texts

There are no formal texts required for this seminar, but participants are encouraged to consult *Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology* (Baum & Smith 2012) and also *Inferring Phylogenies* (Felsenstein 2004) and *Molecular Evolution: A Statistical Approach* (Yang 2014).


## Schedule

### September 14: Introductions

*Who are we, and want to do we want to get out of this seminar?*
* Outline of the course
* Discussion of format for future class sessions
* Outline of “phylogenetics”, i.e., introduction to trees—what is a phylogeny?—and tree thinking—what does this tree say?
* Introduction to Git
* Reading: chapters 1, 2, and 3 of Tree Thinking
* Slides: [outline of phylogenetics](https://github.com/mikeryanmay/IB290/blob/master/content/lecture_slides/git.pdf)
